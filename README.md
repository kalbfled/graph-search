This code implements an abstract base class for graph searching using algorithms presented in, "AI: A Modern Approach," by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.  At the moment, I have only implemented the basic breadth- and depth-first searches.  Use the code by including Frontier.h and GraphSearch.h and creating a subclass of Problem.

The other source files in the repository are for unit testing using the CUTE plugin for the Eclipse IDE.
